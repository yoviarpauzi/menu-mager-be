## Running Server
You can running server with command: 

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Setup database
Before running the server, you must configure the database first. The most important step is to configure `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file: 

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost:port/databaseName
```

Once you have finished configuring `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file, you can generate the database using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

After generating the database, you can migrate it. However, you need to change `DELETE RESTRICT` to `DELETE CASCADE` in the files generated by Prisma, which are located in the prisma/migrations folder. To create a migration file in Prisma, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run db:migrate-create-only
```

After generating the migration file in Prisma and changing `DELETE RESTRICT` to `DELETE CASCADE` in the previously generated migration file, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```
<font style="color:red">**IMPORTANT!**</font> : After running the command above, if the terminal prompts you to create a new migration name, simply press `CTRL + C` to exit the terminal. If you proceed and give the migration a name in the terminal, the changes made earlier (setting `DELETE RESTRICT` to `DELETE CASCADE` in the Prisma migration file) will be undone. This means you will not be able to perform data deletion operations on parent tables that have relationships with other tables. This case only happens occasionally; usually, Prisma will apply the changes immediately.
